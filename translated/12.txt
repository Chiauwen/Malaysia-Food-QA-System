Tegup Pais is a traditional food of Melanau Matu community that is rarely featured compared to other popular foods such as sago and thick.

According to local PAIS entrepreneurs, Easy Ali, 51, Tegup made of natural ingredients such as the Rumbia tree which is then processed into SEI flour or sago flour is one of the traditional foods that can be adopted as a local tourism product.

“These foods are rarely found nowadays due to the shortage of raw materials such as flour from the rumbia tree.

"This is a seasonal food as it depends on the produce of the rumbia tree that grows naturally in the village," he said when met at his residence in Kampung Tian, here recently.

The cooked pais is cooked.

According to Eve, although his main ingredients are difficult to obtain in Matu, he will buy Sei or Sagu flour at Mukah's dry market to ensure a new generation of food.

“In ancient times, this food was unique because the cooking method was only placed on a piece of rumbia tree and put into a hole with a large fire.

"The other ingredients used to make these foods are peanuts, and a little salt and can add sugar to the dough according to their taste," he said.

The finished tastes are blended, grabbed like a cracker, to ensure that the ripen is fully cooked, the rumbia tree skin will be pulled out of the hole.

The solid pais formed like this cracker is cooked and tasty when it is hot.

“If the firm form starts to make it, it shows that the rapid is cooked, the raw tags will be put into the leaves to prevent the firm from burning, if using a wooden kitchen we should be good at controlling the fire.

"It is delicious to eat when it is hot because it will be hard when it is cold and even if the tooth is not strong do not try to eat the cold," joked Eve.

Ending the interview, Eve has hope for the new generation to highlight this traditional food to the outside community as this is a simple and simple way of making it.
