Each race has its own culture, beliefs, and food as well as the Melanau community.The Melanau people are known for their traditional foods such as Umai, Keliseh, Pipuih, and so on.However, this community also has a prohibition on its nutrition.It is divided into two, which is a temporary and permanent prohibition.This is because the Melanau people consider this taboo to be healthy.Recruitment of these abstinence can cause them to suffer, or be exposed to a disease that is difficult to cure.In fact, it is also intended to avoid being hit by a curse or a handmade creature.This prohibition is to give birth to a prosperous human being rather than to prevent it.



Taboo prohibition of food



The Melanau people have many prohibitions that have been revealed since time immemorial.It is charged at certain times such as pain or during childbirth.There are two types of taboo foods such as permanent and temporary prohibitions.It can be considered as the rules that control their behavior.

The permanent prohibition is that it is not allowed to eat in any case according to heritage or heritage.It has been inherited since the ancestors and is still practiced to this day.If violated it is feared that it will be infected such as loss of mind or suffering from illness.For example, some of the Melanau people in Mukah cannot eat sharks, deer meat, pool birds, and so on.It may be due to the events that have happened to their ancestors.

However, it is different between men and women.Women are more likely to be abstained from men.Prohibition of men's prohibitions is more about maintaining their ability and sexual ability.For example, young coconut water is not encouraged to drink by men because it is believed to weaken the inner energy.It clearly shows prevention -based behavior.



Abstinence for prohibition due to heritage or heritage



This abstinence is due to the curse made by their ancestors.This curse causes their descendants to be unable to eat certain foods due to the curse of the ancestors.They had to follow the abstinence to avoid being hit by a catastrophe.For example, there are some families that cannot eat seafood such as squid and so on, and can also eat certain foods.It differs between their families and is determined by the history of their ancestors.

`The beliefs of such curse are still strong in the Melanau community in Sarawak.They are so careful in their diet that they do not eat wrong and then have disaster.



Abstinence prohibition for trust



Trust can also lead to prohibition.The Melanau community believes that nutrition is properly maintained to avoid anger.In fact, it is feared that if not followed will be a catastrophe.

For example, the Melanau community believes that children cannot eat crabs to prevent skin disease.Children are also not allowed to eat bilin fruit.This is because the Melanau community believes that the bilin will cause the girls to die when they are growing up, while for boys, they may be drowned or crocodile.



Absolute Prohibition During Pregnancy



Prohibition during pregnancy for the Melanau community is similar to that of other people especially the Malay community.It is intended to maintain the health of the mother and baby.In the early stages, hot and sharp foods should be avoided as they can damage the fetus.For example, pineapple, water, cane and durian that can cause miscarriage.

In addition, they are not allowed to eat jackfruit and cempeda because they are feared that there are difficult cases.This is because the skin of both fruits is hard and thick. Besides, jackfruit is also believed to cause after childbirth.

In conclusion, each of these prohibitions has its own advantages and disadvantages.However, it remains the remains of the ancestors of the Melanau community and symbolize their identity.Each race has their own taboo and Melanau in particular has a unique and attractive prohibition.
